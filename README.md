##2. Who will use it? 
- **Coaches**: They need to analyze the performance of their teams as well as the performance of individual players.
- **Players**: They will use this application to track their performance (*e.g. how many goals they scored*) to see how 
    well they did in the game.
- **Fans**: They want to know the performance of the clubs and players they are supporting.

##3.Why is this project of interest to you?
 <p>This project is interesting for me because I am a huge soccer fan. I have watched many soccer games and I play 
soccer in my free time. I often check the match statistics of the teams and players that I support, because I think it 
is a good way to measure how well players and teams performed. In this application, I will add functionalities that I 
will be using in real life. This project is a really good chance for me to really combine my interest in soccer and the 
knowledge I learn from this course.</p>
