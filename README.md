# My Home Team 

##1. What will the application do?
   <p>T This application is a tool to give users overview of a team. Users can use this application to check the 
statistics and performance of the team as well as the players in the team. The users can also change these statistics 
for the team and players, as they will change as the season progresses. This application also allows you to add or 
remove players, as in reality, they will join the team or leave the team.
   </p>

##2. Who will use it? 
- **Coaches**: They need to analyze the performance of their teams as well as the performance of individual players.
- **Players**: They will use this application to track their performance (*e.g. how many goals they scored*) to see how 
    well they did.
- **Fans**: They want to know the statistics and performance of the clubs and players they are supporting.

##3.Why is this project of interest to you?
 <p>This project is interesting for me because I am a huge soccer fan. I have watched many soccer games and I play 
soccer in my free time. I often check the match statistics of the team and players that I support, because I think it 
is a good way to measure how well team and players performed. In this application, I will add functionalities that I 
will be using in real life. This project is a really good chance for me to really combine my interest in soccer and the 
knowledge I learned from this course.</p>
